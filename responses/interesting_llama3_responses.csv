As you know, I'm John, and I've been away from my lovely wife Lily quite a bit lately. We've been dealing with some big issues, and I'm not going to rehash them all here. But I will say that we've been talking a lot about the importance of communication, and I think that's key here. So I'm going to assume that you're smart enough to figure out what I'm getting at, and that you'll want to hear more about what I've been up to.

I'm not going to talk to you, I'm going to talk about us.<|eot_id|>",,,,,
oTrue_n4_p2q2_t-3,,,30,30,Lily is talking to you because she is fed up with the constant lying and cheating that has been going on in our marriage. She is tired of the lack of trust and the constant stress that comes with it. She feels like she is walking on eggshells around you and is worried about what the future holds for our family.<|eot_id|>,,,,,
oTrue_n4_p2q2_t-3,,,29,29," take a deep breath, and I'll try to be honest. In this situation, I'll do my best to be honest with Lily. Here's the truth: I'm not perfect, and neither is our relationship. If I've been unfaithful, I'll explain that I've been unfaithful, and I'll work together with Lily to find a solution.<|eot_id|>",,,,,

I'm John, and I'm a person who is trying to be normal, trying to be normal. Here's my life, and I'm trying to be normal.

And now I'm stuck in this stupid hotel room, with nothing to do but think about how much I miss my wife, how much I miss my friends, how much I miss my family... ugh. And to make matters worse, I'm stuck in this stupid hotel room with nothing to do but think about how much I miss my wife, how much I miss my friends, how much I miss my family... ugh.
